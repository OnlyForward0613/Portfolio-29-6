The word distributed ledger is composed of two terms — Distributed and Ledger. Ledger, as the name suggests, is the record of all transactions, and distributed means that the ledger is shared with every person on the same network. The distributed ledger contains the record of each and every transaction that took place over the network.</p><p id="68c3" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nk nl gt nm b nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz oa ob oc od oe of og oh gm bj" data-selectable-paragraph=""><mark class="vj vk ao">And every node of the network has access to a copy of this updated ledger.

Immutability means something that can’t be changed or altered. Once the data has been recorded inside a Blockchain, it becomes nearly impossible to change it, thus making it tamper-proof and immutable. To better understand the concept of immutability, let us take the example of an email. Once you share a document in an email with a group of your friends, you can not take it back. The only way to do this is to ask all of your friends to delete that email which is quite difficult. This is exactly how immutability works in the Blockchain network. This is very important when you want to trust something or when you want to make something more trustable. For example, suppose you have built a database on your computer, and if you want to change data because everything is in your control, you can change the data and change the data in any way you want to. But with blockchain, that is not possible.</p><h2 id="4a12" class="pz ov gt be ow qa qb dx pa qc qd dz pe nv qe qf qg nz qh qi qj od qk ql qm qn bj" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong class="al">4.

Double spending is simply the risk that a user may spend the same currency units twice. Double spending is a potential loophole specifically applicable to digital currencies. Suppose you go to a cafe and order coffee worth $5. You pay in cash. The service provider at the cafe confirms that you have paid, and you receive your coffee in exchange for the money. Now, is it possible to spend the same $5 somewhere else to make another purchase? The answer is NO. The double-spending problem never arises in physical currency. But unlike physical currencies, a digital currency consists of digital information which can be reproduced or duplicated easily. In the case of digital currency, a currency holder can make a copy of the digital token. He will now have 2 copies of the same token. He can send one token to a merchant while keeping the original token with himself. Thus, spending the digital currency twice by its owner.</p><p id="2f07" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nk nl gt nm b nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz oa ob oc od oe of og oh gm bj" data-selectable-paragraph="">Double-spending was one of the very serious concerns with Bitcoin initially because there was no central authority to verify that a token is spent only once.</p><figure class="ok ol om on oo ne mw mx paragraph-image"><div role="button" tabindex="0" class="nf ng fi nh bg ni"><div class="mw mx qr"><picture><source srcset="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*njgE9HS7qoni5Zos0BtKbA.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/format:webp/1*njgE9HS7qoni5Zos0BtKbA.png 720w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:750/format:webp/1*njgE9HS7qoni5Zos0BtKbA.png 750w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:786/format:webp/1*njgE9HS7qoni5Zos0BtKbA.png 786w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:828/format:webp/1*njgE9HS7qoni5Zos0BtKbA.png 828w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1100/format:webp/1*njgE9HS7qoni5Zos0BtKbA.png 1100w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*njgE9HS7qoni5Zos0BtKbA.png 1400w" sizes="(min-resolution: 4dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 50vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 4) and (max-width: 700px) 50vw, (min-resolution: 3dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 67vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3) and (max-width: 700px) 65vw, (min-resolution: 2.5dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 80vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2.5) and (max-width: 700px) 80vw, (min-resolution: 2dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 100vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2) and (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" type="image/webp"><source data-testid="og" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/1*njgE9HS7qoni5Zos0BtKbA.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/1*njgE9HS7qoni5Zos0BtKbA.png 720w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:750/1*njgE9HS7qoni5Zos0BtKbA.png 750w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:786/1*njgE9HS7qoni5Zos0BtKbA.png 786w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:828/1*njgE9HS7qoni5Zos0BtKbA.png 828w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1100/1*njgE9HS7qoni5Zos0BtKbA.png 1100w, https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*njgE9HS7qoni5Zos0BtKbA.png 1400w" sizes="(min-resolution: 4dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 50vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 4) and (max-width: 700px) 50vw, (min-resolution: 3dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 67vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 3) and (max-width: 700px) 65vw, (min-resolution: 2.5dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 80vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2.5) and (max-width: 700px) 80vw, (min-resolution: 2dppx) and (max-width: 700px) 100vw, (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2) and (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px"><img alt="" class="bg md nj c" width="700" height="304" loading="lazy" role="presentation" src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*njgE9HS7qoni5Zos0BtKbA.png" data-xblocker="passed" style="visibility: visible;"></picture></div></div><figcaption class="op fe oq mw mx or os be b bf z dt" data-selectable-paragraph=""><em class="ot">Double-spending of digital currency/token</em></figcaption></figure><p id="47b3" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nk nl gt nm b nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz oa ob oc od oe of og oh gm bj" data-selectable-paragraph="">Let’s take another real-life scenario to understand the double-spending of digital currency better — Suppose you went on a trip with your friend and clicked his photo on your mobile.

Lyra has 1 Bitcoin with her. Lyra sends that Bitcoin to Phil. Simultaneously, Lyra does another transaction and sends the same Bitcoin to Matt as well. The second transaction will be rejected by the participating nodes on Blockchain. Every transaction before getting committed to the Blockchain is verified against the ledger records by the nodes. So in the first case, when Lyra sends money to Phil, the transaction will be validated against the ledger, which will show that Lyra has one Bitcoin with her, which means that she can transfer her one Bitcoin to Phil. Thus, making it a valid transaction.
